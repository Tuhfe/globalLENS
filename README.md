# GlobalLENS Project

This project fetches world news and visualizes them based on region and date range using the News API.

## Files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file where the user interacts.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling for the page.
- `script.js`: Handles the logic of fetching and displaying the data.
- `api.js`: Manages API requests and responses.
- `keywords.js`: Contains functions for extracting keywords from the fetched data.
- `chart.js`: Generates and manages chart data for visual representation.
- `export.js`: Allows exporting the data in JSON format.

## Setup:

1. Download all the files.
2. Insert your own API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
4. Start by selecting your region, language, and date range, and click "Fetch Data".
